        Mary Jackson
      </h2>
      <h3>
         Mary Jackson, born April 9th, 1921, in Hampton, Virginia was our inspiration for this website. She was the first African American female engineer at NASA and helped America win the space race. After retiring from engineering, she became the manager of a women's project at NASA and worked to improve the opportunities for all women in NASA. Being such a inspiring woman and working hard to raise awareness about gender issues in NASA and helping women gain opportunities motivates us to also use our skills to raise awareness and for social causes.
